# TODO:

Calibration button continuously makes new circles when clicking without resetting (completed)

Need a backbutton from calibration to Document
- Need Document id somehow (firebase?)
- Or just keep the back in history version?

Turn Calibrate page Links into buttons

Recalibrate Button: Just stitch clearData and Calibrate functions together

Show accuracy of calibration after calibrating

Add Instructions to Calibrate page (or have inbetween page for them)

Noted Bugs: Turning of send mouse when view mouse is on: circle remains on-top of view mouse toggle
