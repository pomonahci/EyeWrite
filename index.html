        EyeWrite is an online collaborative text editor which utilizes eye tracking to share each user's gaze with their
        collaborators and visualize them in real time on the working document. EyeWrite uses <a
          href='https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/'>WebGazer.js</a> for eye tracking
        capabilities as well as CodeMirror and Firepad for rich-text editing and real time collaboration. EyeWrite
        functions completely on the browser and uses the everyday webcam for eye tracking, providing an easily
        accessible
        environment for close collaboration. EyeWrite also is capable of visualizing each collaborator's mouse movement
        instead of their gaze. The webcam can only be accessed for gaze sharing with the user's consent, and once
        EyeWrite
        is in use the sharing of gaze and mouse data with collaborators can be toggled on and off at the user's
        discretion.

    <h3>Additional EyeWrite Features</h3>
    <p class = "text-justify"> EyeWrite documents have a variety of UI controls and features at your disposal. All document viewers are given a random guest id and color that can be changed at your own discretion for easier collaboration. In addition to sharing gaze among collaborators, users' mouse positions can also be shared and viewed. Whose mouse or gaze you see can be selected in the "All Users" dropdown menu, and how that display appears can be adjusted via the highlight pattern option. In addition to the pattern, the size and gradient ratio can also be adjusted to your choice. </p>
    <p class="text-justify">When it comes to sharing your gaze and/or mouse, you can choose to share either one or both at the same time. However, you can only choose to visualize one or the other to avoid an overload of visualized information. In addition to the sharing of gaze of mice, voice and video calling is also supported on the EyeWrite documents via a peer-to-peer connection. You can join the media call and then choose whether to share your audio or video with others in the call at anytime. Finally, you are able to access the calibration page directly from the document itself if you forget to do so here or just want to recalibrate WebGazer.</p>
